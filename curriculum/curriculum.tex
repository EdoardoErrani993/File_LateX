\section{Resume}
\vspace{2mm} %2mm vertical space
\begin{small}
\\I hold a Master degree in \textbf{Industrial Chemistry}.My commitment in the study of languages and my university echanges abroad have been the base on which I have built a solid knowledge of foreign languages. More specifically, I hold a  C1 level in both textbf{English} and \textbf{Spanish}. Thanks to scientific background and computer skills I started an experience in American consulting company (Accenture).While I am learning on a everyday basis about the new trends of the technology industry, I am looking for jobs (also intership) more similar to my profile where I can combine my scientific skills, the passion for information technology and my predisposition to communication.Following this logic, I am willing to travel from my home country to others location internationally.
